On April 30, 2021 Terri, my wife, was walking our dog Roulette. There are no sidewalks in our neighborhood and she was on the correct side of the road. Driver crossed the center  line, to the wrong side of the road, and hit her from behind. The drive was NOT given a ticket. 

Terri was life-flighted to Little Rock and had back surgery. Broke 2 vertebra in 3 places each. Surgery was required to prevent spinal cord injury. She is slowly recovering but has a long road ahead.  

I am taking FMLA to take care of her.
